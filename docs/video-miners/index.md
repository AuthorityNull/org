# Video Miners

This section of the livepeer.org documentation is for **video miners**.

Video miners in the Livepeer network provide transcoding services (and in the future other video infrastructure services as well) that allow developers to build scalable video applications and are compensated with Livepeer token (LPT) and Ethereum (ETH). While the term "miner" was popularized in the context of Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains such as Bitcoin where it referred to participants that used computational power to secure the blockchain, in the context of Livepeer, the term miner refers to participants that use computational power to provide transcoding services in an open marketplace to developers.
