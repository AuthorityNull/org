Welcome! The pages that follow contain comprehensive documentation of the
Livepeer ecosystem. The documentation is split into two parts: Livepeer for
[video application developers](./developers/index.md) and Livepeer for
[video miners](./video-miners/index.md). If you are new to Livepeer and
interested in how it works, you might want to check out the
[Protocol Overview](./protocol/core-concepts/index.md).
