# Video Application Developers

This section of the livepeer.org documentation is for people who want to
integrate Livepeer live transcoding into their video application. There are many
uses for Livepeer transcoding, and the Livepeer community is excited to see what
you build.

If you are looking for documentation for the hosted Livepeer.com transcoding
service, visit [https://livepeer.com/docs/](livepeer.com/docs).

## Broadcaster = Video Application Developer

Sometimes, you'll see video application developers referred to as "broadcasters"
in the Livepeer documentation. This is because in order to leverage Livepeer
transcoding in your application, video application developers need to run
Livepeer broadcasting software. Video application developers broadcast video
into the Livepeer network and receive transcoded video back from the network.

## Supported ingest and playback formats

The only prerequisite for integrating Livepeer transcoding into your video
application workflow is ability to create an RTMP stream or HTTP push a stream
of .ts segments.

You can configure Livepeer to transcode your stream into an HLS or MP4 video.

New transcoding features, ingest types and encoding formats are actively under
development. You can contribute too. Livepeer is an open source project.
